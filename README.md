# VotesApp
Application for organizing live votes for parties, conferences, meetings, and other gatherings of people.
The idea is that we'll have a collection of things to vote from: Movies, songs, programming languages, Horse JS quotes, anything. The app will put them against each other in pairs, so that on each round people can vote for their favorite of the pair. When there's just one thing left, that's the winner.
